# How to fork a GitHub repository
Use this guide to create your own copy of an original repository (repo) without changing the original repo. Forking (creating a copy of) a developer’s original repo allows you to work on your own copy of the original repo. You can test changes, make improvements, or use the copy as inspiration for your own projects.

This guide references repos found on GitHub, a site that commonly hosts open-source projects, such as software development projects, and offers version control. **This guide covers how to fork a repo both with and without using the command line.**
